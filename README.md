This project was created as a part of my college Python course.  
The main objective is to apply the concepts learned in class to a real-world problem by:
- Identifying a meaningful problem
- Designing a Python-based solution
- Implementing it using the tools and methods taught in the course
 -Demonstrating understanding through documentation and output screenshots

  It takes input from the user, processes it, and displays the output accordingly.
